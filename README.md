Loan Calculator project is a simple program that calculates the total amount of a loan with an initial principal amount of $1000 over a period of 10 years with an interest rate of 5%. The program uses a loop to iterate through each year and calculates the interest amount based on the previous year's balance and the interest rate. The output is a table showing the balance after each year. The results are rounded to two decimal places for easy reading. This project is useful for individuals who want to see the growth of their loan over time and make informed decisions about their financial situation. |
| 20 | [Number List Generator](https://github.com/ritw237/Number-List-Generator_Day20_100DaysOfPython) | What are ten things you can always count on? Your fingers. Or this number generator I made. This project is a Number List Generator that allows the user to enter a starting number, an ending number, and an increment. The program then generates a list of numbers starting from the starting number, and increasing by the specified increment, until it reaches the ending number. The program uses a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers and outputs each number to the console. |
| 21 | [Math Game](https://github.com/ritw237/Day-21-of-100DaysOfPython-Math-Game) | I built a math game. This is a simple math game that tests the player's knowledge of multiplication. The player is asked to pick a number and answer the correct multiples of that number. For each correct answer, the player will earn a point. The game goes on for 10 rounds and at the end of the game, the player's score is displayed. If the player answers all 10 questions correctly, they will receive a special message, otherwise, their score out of 10 is displayed. |
| 22 | [Random Number Generator](https://github.com/ritw237/Day-22-of-100DaysOfPython) | Guess a totally random number between 1 and 1 million. This project is a guessing game where the user has to guess a number between 0 and a million. The game randomly generates a number and the user has to guess what it is. The game will inform the user if their guess is too low or too high and keep track of the number of attempts. If the user correctly guesses the number, the game will print the number of attempts it took them to guess it and declare that they have won. |
| 23 | [Login System](https://github.com/ritw237/Login_System_Day-23_100DaysOfPython) | Ok you might have cracked my earlier login but let's try a better one üîê. A login system where the user is prompted to input their username and password. The real username and password are stored in variables and if the input matches, the user is welcomed and informed that they are logged in. If the inputs do not match, the user is asked to try again. The program uses the getpass function to hide the password input from the user for security purposes.  |
| 24 | [Infinity Dice](https://github.com/ritw237/Infinity-Dice_Day-24_100DaysOfPython) | The Infinity Dice üé≤ game is a simple dice simulation program that allows the user to choose the number of sides they want on their dice. The user can then roll the dice as many times as they like, with the results of each roll being displayed on the screen. The program uses the random module in Python to generate random numbers, simulating the rolling of a dice. The user can choose to roll again by inputting "yes" or stop rolling by entering anything other than "yes". This program is a fun and interactive way to pass time and challenge your luck!  |
| 25 | [Character Health Stat Generator](https://github.com/ritw237/Character_Health_Stat_Generator_Day-25-of-100DaysOfPython) |  Built a character health stats generator to prepare for the epic battle in 3 days!!!üòè. This code is a character health stat generator for a warrior in a role-playing game. The user is prompted to name their warrior and then has the option to generate new health stats using a random number generator. The generator rolls two dice, a 6 sided and an 8 sided, and multiplies the results to give the final health stat. The process can be repeated until the user decides to stop generating new stats.|
| 26 | [Music Player](https://github.com/ritw237/Music-Player-Day-26-of-100DaysOfPython) | My personal music player üé∂üéß. This is a simple music player script written in Python that allows the user to play a music file and pause it. The program starts by displaying a menu with two options: 1 to play music and 2 to exit. If the user selects option 1, the music starts playing and they can pause it at any time by pressing 'p'. The program continues to run until the user exits by selecting option 2. The program uses the replit audio module to play the music file and the os module to clear the screen. This project is a basic introduction to working with audio and user inputs in Python. |
| 27 | [Character Builder](https://github.com/ritw237/Character_Builder-Day-27-of-100DaysOfPython) | Built a character builder that displays health, strength, agility, intelligence, charisma with an epic quote at the end. This code generates a character builder where the user can name their character and choose from 4 different character types (Human, Elf, Wizard, Orc). The code then calculates the health, strength, agility, intelligence, and charisma values for the character using random number generation. Finally, it selects a random epic quote for the character based on their type from a predefined dictionary of quotes. The program allows the user to continue building new characters until they choose to exit.|
| [28](#day-28) | [Automated Battle System Multi-player Multi-round RPG](https://github.com/ritw237/Day-28-Automated-Battle-System-Multiplayer-Multiround-RPG) | Automated Battle System Multi-player Multi-round RPG. Also added unit tests to the functions to the game code. |
