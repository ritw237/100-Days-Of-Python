# 100 Days of Python

I am embarking on a journey to code in Python every day for 100 days! This challenge originated on Replit, with the title 'Replit 100 Days of Code'. 
- üèÅ This repository will serve as a journal of my progress and projects I work on during this time. 
- üçÅ I will update it regularly as I make progress.
- ü§Ø 100 projects of Python over 100 Days  
- ‚ö° Whenever I finish a Day's progress (made the project and pushed it to Github and my replit), I will tweeet about it too on here -> [![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitter-1DA1F2?style=for-the-badge&logo=twitter&logoColor=white)](https://twitter.com/ritwiksrivast11)

| 1 | [Introduction to 100 Days of Python](https://github.com/ritw237/Day-1_100DaysOfPython) | This is the first day of my 100 Days of Python challenge. I am signing up for this challenge and committing to spending at least 10 minutes every day coding along. I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE, so I can code from anywhere. My goal is to make consistent progress and improve my Python skills.

| 3 | [Cook it Up!](https://github.com/ritw237/Day-3_100DaysOfPython-Wacky-Recipe-Maker-mini-project) | A fun and interactive program that creates a personalized dish based on user inputs. In this fun and interactive program, you get to enter your favorite recipe, plant, cooking method, and household item to create a unique dish. Choose from baking, frying, or any other cooking method you prefer and add a touch of ruined food and a bed of your favorite household item. The result is a quirky and personalized dish that's sure to be a hit in the kitchen. So get ready to cook it up and see what amazing dish you can create!|
| 4 | [Adventure Story Simulator](https://github.com/ritw237/Day-4-of-100daysofPython) | This program creates an epic adventure story based on input from the user. The user is asked to provide their name, the name of their enemy, their super power, where they live and their favorite food.

| 5 | [Marvel Character Identifier](https://github.com/ritw237/Day-5-of-100daysofPython) | This program asks the user a series of yes or no questions and determines if they resemble a character from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The user is asked if they like hanging around, if they have a gravelly voice, and if they often feel Marvelous. Based on their answers, the program determines if they are Spider-man, Korg, or Captain Marvel. If the user does not match any of the characters, the program informs them that they are not a Marvel character. ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è|
